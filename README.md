# What is LEAFify? 

Leafify is a web application developed by team HacKiiT, it serves purpose of identifying medicinal plants using image processing and ML algorithm.

## How to use LEAFify?

[click here](http://leafify.framer.ai) to redirect to our website.

1. upload the image of the herb either using camera lens or from your device

2. the application will identify and produce name and additional information of the identified herb.


## Tech stack

- Pytorch- used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing.
We opted to use this particular machine learning framework because of its ability to customise
- Matplotlib, Numpy, Torch - Built in pytorch dependencies, that we are using to train   our model.
- Tailwind CSS, Framer, GSAP-  For styling and animation
- ReactJS/NextJS, NodeJS/BunJS- Integration of multiple text tags.
- Tensorflow JS - For the Ml integration
- OPENAI - For integrating chatgpt features



## features

* identifies the plant and generates its scientific name

## work in progress

* additional data regarding the plant including but not limited to medicinal uses, regional availabilty
* generation of 3D models of the identified herb
* (reccomendation of nearest match if herb not in dataset?)
